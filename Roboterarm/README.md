# CAD Model Creo8 for Student Workshops

All files nedded to open the Assembly of the complete model are in this Folder.

You need Creo8 or newer Versions to open the .prt files.
To open everything you need to define the Folder as working space and open the "roboterarm_gesamt.asm"

Otherwise there ist a .stp file of the whole assembly if you don't have creo. As well as a folder for the .stl files of the 3D printing parts.

## The fingers of the gripper "finger_v2_" need to be printed in flexible material such as TPU!

Missing are detailed electronics, threaded inserts and most of the screws, washers and the 320mm belts for the Joints.
